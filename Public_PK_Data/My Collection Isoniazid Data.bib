abstract = {One of the most effective and widely used antituberculosis (anti-TB) drugs is isoniazid (INH), a prodrug activated via oxidation that forms an adduct with NAD(+) to inhibit NADH-dependent targets of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, such as enoyl-acyl carrier protein reductase (InhA). The metabolic by-products and potentially toxic intermediates resulting from INH therapy have been identified through a large body of work. However, an INH-NAD adduct or structures related to this adduct have not been identified in specimens from human TB patients or animal models of TB. Analyses by mass spectrometry of urine collected from TB patients in a study conducted by the NIAID-funded Tuberculosis Research Unit identified 4-isonicotinoylnicotinamide (C(12)H(9)N(3)O(2)) as a novel metabolite of INH therapy. This compound was formed by M. tuberculosis strains in a KatG-dependent manner but could also be produced by mice treated with INH independent of an M. tuberculosis infection. Thus, the 4-isonicotinoylnicotinamide observed in human urine samples is likely derived from the degradation of oxidized INH-NAD adducts and provides direct evidence of host INH activation.},

abstract = {Background/aim: Isoniazid (INH) is an essential component of first-line anti-tuberculosis (TB) treatment. However, treatment with INH is complicated by polymorphisms in the expression of the enzyme system primarily responsible for its elimination, N-acetyltransferase 2 (NAT2), and its associated hepatotoxicity. The objective of this study was to develop an individualized INH dosing regimen using a pharmacogenetic-driven model and to apply this regimen in a pilot study. Methods: A total of 206 patients with TB who received anti-TB treatment were included in this prospective study. The 2-hour post-dose concentrations of INH were obtained, and their NAT2 genotype was determined using polymerase chain reaction and sequencing. A multivariate regression analysis that included the variables of age, sex, body weight, and NAT2 genotype was performed to determine the best model for estimating the INH dose that achieves a concentration of 3.0–6.0 mg/L. This dosing algorithm was then used for newly enrolled 53 patients. Results: Serum concentrations of INH were significantly lower in the rapid-acetylators than in the slow-acetylators (2.55 mg/L vs 6.78 mg/L, median, P,0.001). A multivariate stepwise linear regression analysis revealed that NAT2 and body weight independently affected INH concentrations: INH concentration (mg/L) =13.821-0.1× (body weight, kg) −2.273× (number of high activity alleles of NAT2; 0, 1, 2). In 53 newly enrolled patients, the frequency at which they were within the therapeutic range of 3.0–6.0 mg/L was higher in the model-based treatment group compared to the standard treatment group (80.8{\%} vs 59.3{\%}). Conclusion: The use of individualized pharmacogenetic-guided INH dosage regimens that incorporate NAT2 genotype and body weight may help to ensure achievement of therapeutic concentrations of INH in the TB patients.},

We hypothesized that the internationally recommended dosage should be increased for patients with two active NAT2 alleles (RA type) in order to achieve appropriate antituberculous efficiency; however, the pharmacokinetic effects of the dose increase have not been fully addressed. To estimate an optimal dosage for RA-type patients, we conducted a dose escalation study in healthy male volunteers carrying NAT2*4/*4. METHODS: Oral doses of 300 mg, 600 mg, and 900 mg of INH were administered to eight RA-type subjects, whereas 300 mg was administered to eight IA-type subjects with one active allele (NAT2*4). The pharmacokinetic parameters were estimated from plasma INH concentrations for 24 h postdose. RESULTS: The ratio of the mean area under the plasma-concentration time curve (AUC) was not proportional to the doses (1:2.6:5.0 for 300:600:900-mg dose) in parallel to the plasma concentration at 1 h (C(1)) and 2 h (C(2)) after administration. Compared with the IA-type group given 300 mg, the RA-type group had lower pharmacokinetic parameters at 300 mg (AUC, 66{\%}; C(1), 72{\%}; C(2), 61{\%}), but higher parameters at 600 mg (AUC, 175{\%}; C(1), 196{\%}; C(2), 170{\%}). Plasma concentrations of the IA-type group were within the therapeutic range. An optimal INH dose was calculated as 430 mg (7.2 mg/kg) for RA-type subjects to obtain an AUC comparable with that in IA-type subjects dosed with 300 mg. CONCLUSION: In RA-type subjects, the pharmacokinetic parameters appeared to lack linearity with the increased dose of INH. We propose that the proper daily dose for RA-type patients is 1.5-times higher than that currently recommended.},

Blood was obtained prior to administration of the first dose, 1 h after administration of the last dose, and at the completion of bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), which was performed 4 h after administration of the last dose. The metabolism of caffeine was used to determine acetylator status. Standardized bronchoscopy was performed without systemic sedation. The volume of epithelial lining fluid (ELF) recovered was calculated by the urea dilution method. Isoniazid concentrations in plasma, BAL fluid, and alveolar cells (ACs) were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography. AIDS status or gender had no significant effect on the concentrations of isoniazid in plasma at 1 or 4 h. Concentrations in plasma at 4 h and concentrations in ELF were greater in slow acetylators than fast acetylators. The concentration in plasma (1.85 +/- 1.60 microg/ml [mean +/- standard deviation; n = 80]) at 1 h following administration of the last dose was not significantly different from that in ELF (2.25 +/- 3.50 microg/ml) or ACs (2.61 +/- 5.01 microg/ml). For the entire study group, concentrations in plasma at 1 h were less than 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0 microg/ml for 34.7, 60, and 82.7{\%} of the subjects, respectively; concentrations in ELF were less than 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0 microg/ml in 30 (37.5{\%}), 53 (66.0{\%}), and 58 (72.5{\%}) of the subjects, respectively; and concentrations in ACs were less than 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0 microg/ml in 43 (53.8{\%}), 59 (73.8{\%}), and 65 (81.3{\%}) of the subjects, respectively. The concentrations of orally administered isoniazid in plasma were not affected by gender or the presence of AIDS. The concentrations in plasma at 4 h and the concentrations in ELF, but not the concentrations in ACs, were significantly greater in slow acetylators than fast acetylators. Concentrations in plasma and lungs were low compared to recommended therapeutic concentrations in plasma and published MICs of isoniazid for Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The optimal concentrations of isoniazid in ACs and ELF are unknown, but these data suggest that the drug enters these compartments by passive diffusion and achieves concentrations similar to those found in plasma.},

N-Acetylation is subject to polymorphism, and humans can be categorized as either fast or slow acetylators according to their ability to N-acetylate certain arylamine substrates in vivo. Genetic variants at the polymorphic NAT2 locus have been described. We expressed five of the most common NAT2 variants (NAT2 4, NAT2 5A, NAT2 5B, NAT2 6A and NAT2 7B) in Escherichia coli as a convenient source of the human variants. The apparent Kmvalues (at 100 $\mu$M acetyl CoA as co-substrate) of the different NAT2 variants for sulphamethazine, dapsone, p-anisidine, 2-aminofluorene, procainamide and isoniazid were determined. Data show that the apparent Kmof the slow variant NAT2 7B for the arylamine sulphamethazine was 10-fold lower than all the other allotypes. The apparent Kmfor the structurally related sulphone antibiotic dapsone was 5-fold lower for the slow variant NAT2 7B when compared with the wild-type NAT2 4. These results indicate that the NAT2 7B specific amino acid substitution, Gly286-Glu, is important in promoting the binding of sulphamethazine and dapsone to the active site. {\textcopyright} 1995.},

METHODS A total of 24 healthy Chinese subjects, consisting of eight homozygous wild types (wt/wt), eight heterozygous mutants (m/wt) and eight homozygous mutants (m/m) for NAT2, were enrolled in the study. The blood samples (0-14 h) of the subjects were taken after oral administration of a single dose (300 mg) of INH. Concentrations of INH and AcINH in plasma were measured by a reversed-phase HPLC method. RESULTS The ratio of AcINH and INH (R(A/I)) 3 h post-dose of wt/wt, m/wt and m/m groups were 3.22 ± 1.34, 1.35 ± 0.20 and 0.22 ± 0.06, respectively (p{\textless}0.01). The area under concentration-time curve (AUC) values of three groups were 10.35 ± 2.12, 16.34 ± 3.05, 42.24 ± 8.51 mg/h/L for INH and 42.19 ± 8.80, 38.05 ± 5.32, 19.78 ± 3.72 mg/h/L for AcINH, respectively (p{\textless}0.01). There was a good linear relationship between pharmacokinetic parameters and the number of active NAT2 genes. CONCLUSIONS The results suggest that there is a conspicuous gene dose effect in the pharmacokinetics of INH and AcINH. This finding may be valuable in the personalized therapy of tuberculosis with INH.},

abstract = {In the pathogenesis of isoniazid-induced hepatic injury, cytochrome P450-dependent metabolic activation of the metabolite, acetylhydrazine (AcHz), is the crucial step. Exhalation of [14C]-carbon dioxide has previously been used to quantify indirectly this pathway. In contrast, according to the current concept of AcHz bioactivation, molecular nitrogen is produced directly, but has not yet been identified. Here, we measured [15N]-nitrogen and 14CO2 exhalation, after the administration of [15N2]-[14C]-AcHz, in rats. Laser magnetic resonance (LMR) spectroscopy, a new sensitive and specific technique for the measurement of 15N and 14N in gas samples, was used. To demonstrate the involvement of cytochrome P450, rats were treated with phenobarbital (PB) or PB+cobalt(II) chloride (CoCl2) (n = 3 in each group). Time-dependent 15N2 exhalation differed significantly between treatment groups (p {\textless} 0.001). At 240 min, cumulative exhalation of 15N was 1.92 +/- 0.43{\%} (mean +/- SE) of the dose in the control group, 2.53 +/- 0.23{\%} in the PB group, and 1.00 +/- 0.15{\%} in the PB+CoCl2 group (p {\textless} 0.05 compared to controls, p {\textless} 0.01 compared to PB). Cumulative exhalation of 14CO2 in 24 h ranged from 15.1 to 21.9{\%}, with no significant difference between treatment groups. In conclusion, N2 is a metabolite of AcHz. N2 formation reflects the cytochrome P450-mediated activation of AcHz and can be used as an index of this pathway. Generally, LMR spectroscopy is valuable for monitoring any N2-liberating process in vivo.},

abstract = {To test the hypothesis that slow acetylators, who may have a greater risk of developing isoniazid hepatitis than rapid acetylators, are exposed to more acetylhydrazine and hydrazine, two toxic metabolites of isoniazid, the urinary excretion of hydrazino metabolites of isoniazid was measured following the ingestion of 300 mg isoniazid. Slow acetylators (n = 7) excreted significantly more isoniazid (32.4 vs 9.2{\%} dose), acetylhydrazine (3.1 vs 1.6{\%} dose), and hydrazine (1.0 vs 0.4{\%} dose) in 24 h than rapid acetylators (n = 5), whereas the excretion of acetylisoniazid and diacetylhydrazine was significantly lower. As the acetylation (i.e. detoxification) of acetylhydrazine is inhibited in the presence of high concentrations of isoniazid, a study was also made of the effect of a slow-release preparation that results in lower plasma concentrations of isoniazid on the production of hydrazino metabolites. The ratio of acetylisoniazid to isoniazid in urine was significantly increased in slow acetylators from 0.84 to 1.02 following administration of the slow release preparation, indicating increased acetylation of isoniazid. However, the excretion of diacetylhydrazine relative to the excretion of acetylhydrazine and hydrazine did not change. It is concluded that exposure to toxic metabolites of isoniazid is increased in slow acetylators. Detoxification of the toxic metabolites was not enhanced by a slow-release preparation of isoniazid.},

The mean apparent KM values for the monomorphic substrate PABA were 70 +/- 20, 180 +/- 50, and 310 +/- 30 microM for the slow, intermediate, and very rapid enzymes, respectively, whereas the polymorphic substrate SMZ exhibited little interphenotypic KM variation. Compared to the slow enzymes, the rapid acetylators exhibited mean apparent Vmax values 15- and 20-fold greater for PABA and SMZ, respectively. Furthermore, under in vitro conditions where enzyme saturation was achieved, PABA showed polymorphic acetylation characteristics, in contrast to events in vivo, where monomorphic acetylation patterns were observed. As the acetyl coenzyme A concentration in the reaction mixture was increased, the KM and Vmax for PABA increased, in accordance with "ping-pong" kinetic principles. As occurs with polymorphic substrates, a binary ping-pong mechanism appears to govern N-acetylation of monomorphic substrates in human liver, as evidenced by initial velocity patterns and limiting values for the KM and Vmax for PABA.},

abstract = {Laboratory studies have questioned nonadherence as a cause of antituberculosis drug failure and propose that between-patient pharmacokinetic variability may be the cause. This meta-analysis provides clinical evidence that pharmacokinetic variability of isoniazid alone leads to worse microbiological failure, relapse, and acquired drug resistance.Background. Using hollow-fiber tuberculosis studies, we recently demonstrated that nonadherence is not a significant factor for ADR and that therapy failure only occurs after a large proportion of doses are missed. Computer-aided clinical trial simulations have suggested that isoniazid and rifampin pharmacokinetic variability best explained poor outcomes. We were interested in determining whether isoniazid pharmacokinetic variability was associated with either microbiological failure or ADR in the clinic.Methods. Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines were followed. Prospective, randomized, controlled clinical trials that reported isoniazid acetylation status and microbiological outcomes were selected. The main effects examined were microbiological sputum conversion, ADR, and relapse. Effect size was expressed as pooled risk ratios (RRs) comparing rapid with slow acetylators.Results. Thirteen randomized studies with 1631 rapid acetylators and 1751 slow acetylators met inclusion and exclusion criteria. Rapid acetylators were more likely than slow acetylators to have microbiological failure (RR, 2.0; 95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 1.5–2.7), ADR (RR, 2.0; CI, 1.1–3.4), and relapse (RR, 1.3; CI, .9–2.0). Higher failure rates were encountered even in drug regimens comprising {\textgreater}3 antibiotics. No publication bias or small-study effects were observed for the outcomes evaluated.Conclusions. Pharmacokinetic variability to a single drug in the regimen is significantly associated with failure of therapy and ADR in patients. This suggests that individualized dosing for tuberculosis may be more effective than standardized dosing, which is prescribed in directly observed therapy programs. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

abstract = {Isoniazid (INH) is metabolized by polymorphic N-acetyltransferase2 (NAT2). In the present study, the relationship between the NAT2 genotype and the INH acetylator phenotype was examined in Japanese tuberculous patients and compared with healthy subjects. Subjects were classified according to the genotyping into NAT2*5B (allele4), NAT2*6A (allele3) and NAT2*7B (allele2), using the PCR-RFLP method. Twelve healthy subjects and 7 tuberculous patients participated in the INH acetylator phenotyping study, in which each subject was administered an oral dose of INH, followed by urine sampling for 24 h. Urinary concentrations of INH and N-acetylisoniazid (AcINH) were measured by the HPLC method. The urinary recoveries of INH ({\%} of dose) in healthy subjects in relation to NAT2 genotyping were as follows: 6.4+/-2.2 in the homozygotes for the wild-type allele, 10.7+/-2.2 in the compound heterozygotes for the mutant allele, and 38.6+/-6.4 in the homozygotes for the mutant allele. In the patients study, the findings in the corresponding three groups were 4.0+/-1.7, 8.8 and 18.3+/-9.3. Although no significant difference was found because of the lower systemic exposure of INH in patients compared with healthy subjects, there were differences in the disposition kinetics of INH between subjects with and without mutations in the NAT2 gene, and these findings were observed not only in healthy subjects but also in patients who had comedicated drugs and hepatic dysfunctions. The findings indicated that the metabolism of INH by NAT2 is clearly impaired in subjects with mutations in the NAT2 gene, and thus genotyping for three NAT2 point mutations was adequate to predict the metabolism of INH in Japanese tuberculous patients as well as healthy subjects. This NAT2 genotyping could become a useful alternative to TDM for INH.},

abstract = {Among first-line antituberculosis drugs, isoniazid (INH) displays the greatest early bactericidal activity (EBA) and is key to reducing contagiousness in treated patients. The pulmonary pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of INH have not been fully characterized with modeling and simulation approaches. INH concentrations measured in plasma, epithelial lining fluid, and alveolar cells for 89 patients, including fast acetylators (FAs) and slow acetylators (SAs), were modeled by use of population pharmacokinetic modeling. Then the model was used to simulate the EBA of INH in lungs and to investigate the influences of INH dose, acetylator status, and M. tuberculosis MIC on this effect. A three-compartment model adequately described INH concentrations in plasma and lungs. With an MIC of 0.0625 mg/liter, simulations showed that the mean bactericidal effect of a standard 300-mg daily dose of INH was only 11{\%} lower for FA subjects than for SA subjects and that dose increases had little influence on the effects in either FA or SA subjects. With an MIC value of 1 mg/liter, the mean bactericidal effect associated with a 300-mg daily dose of INH in SA subjects was 41{\%} greater than that in FA subjects. With the same MIC, increasing the daily INH dose from 300 mg to 450 mg resulted in a 22{\%} increase in FA subjects. These results suggest that patients infected with M. tuberculosis with low-level resistance, especially FA patients, may benefit from higher INH doses, while dose adjustment for acetylator status has no significant impact on the EBA in patients with low-MIC strains.},

abstract = {In this study, we aimed to quantify the effects of the N-acetyltransferase 2 (NAT2) phenotype on isoniazid (INH) metabolism in vivo and identify other sources of pharmacokinetic variability following single-dose administration in healthy Asian adults. The concentrations of INH and its metabolites acetylisoniazid (AcINH) and isonicotinic acid (INA) in plasma were evaluated in 33 healthy Asians who were also given efavirenz and rifampin. The pharmacokinetics of INH, AcINH, and INA were analyzed using nonlinear mixed-effects modeling (NONMEM) to estimate the population pharmacokinetic parameters and evaluate the relationships between the parameters and the elimination status (fast, intermediate, and slow acetylators), demographic status, and measures of renal and hepatic function. A two-compartment model with first-order absorption best described the INH pharmacokinetics. AcINH and INA data were best described by a two- and a one-compartment model, respectively, linked to the INH model. In the final model for INH, the derived metabolic phenotypes for NAT2 were identified as a significant covariate in the INH clearance, reducing its interindividual variability from 86{\%} to 14{\%}. The INH clearance in fast eliminators was 1.9- and 7.7-fold higher than in intermediate and slow eliminators, respectively (65 versus 35 and 8 liters/h). Creatinine clearance was confirmed as a significant covariate for AcINH clearance. Simulations suggested that the current dosing guidelines (200 mg for 30 to 45 kg and 300 mg for {\textgreater}45 kg) may be suboptimal (3 mg/liter ≤ Cmax ≤ 6 mg/liter) irrespective of the acetylator class. The analysis established a model that adequately characterizes INH, AcINH, and INA pharmacokinetics in healthy Asians. Our results refine the NAT2 phenotype-based predictions of the pharmacokinetics for INH.},

abstract = {The current treatment regimen against drug susceptible tuberculosis (DS-TB) was defined by the 1980s. Since then the emergence of the global HIV pandemic and the escalation of drug resistant (DR-) forms of TB have presented new challenges for therapeutic research. Priority goals include shortening DS-TB treatment, improving DR-TB treatment and making combined TB-HIV therapy easier. To help achieve these goals, a range of new drugs and treatment strategies are currently being evaluated. Phase IIb and III clinical trials are ongoing to assess combinations involving the high-dose rifamycins, the 8-methoxyquinolones, a diarylquinoline (bedaquiline) and the nitroimidazoles. Other compounds (e.g. novel oxazolidinones and ethylenediamines) are at earlier stages of clinical development. Overall, there are grounds for optimism that recent advances will contribute towards achievement of new treatment regimens in the foreseeable future. However, long-term investment, political commitment and scientific endeavour are crucial to ensure that progress is sustained and the benefits of recent advances reach those in the greatest need.},

abstract = {Isoniazid is metabolized by the genetically polymorphic arylamine N-acetyltransferase type 2 (NAT2). A greater number of high-activity alleles are related to increased acetylation capacity and in some reports to low efficacy and toxicity of isoniazid. The objective of this study was to assess individual isoniazid exposure based on NAT2 genotype to predict a personalized therapeutic dose. Isoniazid was administered to 18 healthy Caucasians (age 30 +/- 6 years, body weight 74 +/- 10 kg, five women) in random order as a 200-mg infusion, a 100-mg oral, and a 300-mg oral single dose. For the assessment of NAT2 genotype, common single nucleotide polymorphisms identifying 99.9{\%} of variant alleles were characterized. Noncompartmental pharmacokinetics and compartmental population pharmacokinetics were estimated from isoniazid plasma concentrations until 24 h postdose by high-pressure liquid chromatography. The influence of NAT2 genotype, drug formulation, body weight, and sex on dose-normalized isoniazid pharmacokinetics was assessed by analysis of variance from noncompartmental data and confirmed by population pharmacokinetics. Eight high-activity NAT2*4 alleles were identified. Sex had no effect; the other factors explained 93{\%} of the variability in apparent isoniazid clearance (analysis of variance). NAT2 genotype alone accounted for 88{\%} of variability. Individual isoniazid clearance could be predicted as clearance (liters/hour) = 10 + 9 x (number of NAT2*4 alleles). To achieve similar isoniazid exposure, current standard doses presumably appropriate for patients with one high-activity NAT2 allele may be decreased or increased by approximately 50{\%} for patients with no or two such alleles, respectively. Prospective clinical trials are required to assess the merits of this approach.},

abstract = {Arylamine N-acetyltransferase 2 (NAT2) modifies drug efficacy/toxicity and cancer risk due to its role in bioactivation and detoxification of arylamine and hydrazine drugs and carcinogens. Human NAT2 alleles possess a combination of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with slow acetylation phenotypes. Clinical and molecular epidemiology studies investigating associations of NAT2 genotype with drug efficacy/toxicity and/or cancer risk are compromised by incomplete and sometimes conflicting information regarding genotype/phenotype relationships. Studies in our laboratory and others have characterized the functional effects of SNPs alone, and in combinations present in alleles or haplotypes. We extrapolate this data generated following recombinant expression in yeast and COS-1 cells to assist in the interpretation of NAT2 structure. Whereas previous structural studies used homology models based on templates of N-acetyltransferase enzyme crystal structures from various prokaryotic species, alignment scores between bacterial and mammalian N-acetyltransferase protein sequences are low (approximately 30{\%}) with important differences between the bacterial and mammalian protein structures. Recently, the crystal structure of human NAT2 was released from the Protein Data Bank under accession number 2PFR. We utilized the NAT2 crystal structure to evaluate the functional effects of SNPs resulting in the protein substitutions R64Q (G191A), R64W (C190T), I114T (T341C), D122N (G364A), L137F (A411T), Q145P (A434C), E167K (G499A), R197Q (C590A), K268R (A803G), K282T (A845C), and G286E (G857A) of NAT2. This analysis advances understanding of NAT2 structure-function relationships, important for interpreting the role of NAT2 genetic polymorphisms in bioactivation and detoxification of arylamine and hydrazine drugs and carcinogens.},

abstract = {Intermittent tuberculosis treatment regimens have been developed to facilitate treatment supervision. Their efficacy has been substantiated by clinical trials and tuberculosis control programmes, notwithstanding the lack of head-to-head comparison between daily and intermittent regimens. Recently, there has been opposing evidence from observational studies, pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic studies and animal models that intermittent treatment increases the risk of relapse, treatment failure or acquired rifamycin resistance, especially among HIV-infected patients. Systematic reviews have been conflicting. PubMed, Ovid MEDLINE and EMBASE were systematically searched for publications in English to evaluate the evidence about dosing schedules and treatment efficacy. Levels of evidence and grades of recommendation were assigned largely according to clinical evidence with reference to the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network guideline development handbook. A total of 32 articles were included after excluding 331 ineligible articles, 42 non-analytical studies, 22 narrative reviews or expert opinions and 44 articles embedded in systematic reviews. These included 9 systematic reviews, 8 controlled studies, 9 pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic studies, 5 mouse studies and 1 article about guinea pig experiments. Findings suggest high levels of evidence for using daily dosing schedules, especially during the initial phase in the presence of cavitation, isoniazid resistance and advanced HIV co-infection, to reduce the risk of treatment failure, recurrence and acquired drug resistance including acquired rifamycin resistance. This review justifies the use of daily schedules in standard tuberculosis treatment regimens (particularly in the initial phase), corroborates prevailing understanding of pharmacokinetics-pharmacodynamics and mycobacterial persisters, and supports exploration of rifapentine-containing regimens in higher dosages and frequency.},

This paper compares the effectiveness of 9 months of isoniazid with 4 months of transitional rifampin (9H4R) to alternative therapies, including 9INH, 6 months of isoniazid (6INH) and 6 months of isoniazid with 4 months of transitional rifampin (6H4R), for treatment of LTBI. MATERIALS {\&} METHODS Using an ethnically diverse clinic sample of 552 patients given treatment for LTBI with 9H4R, we use multilevel selection models to examine the adjusted comparative effectiveness of the regimens among ethnic groups that feature distinct genetic predispositions to side effects on INH. For unadjusted/absolute effectiveness, we simulated cost-effectiveness ratios for 4 months of rifampin (4RIF) and compared with bootstrapped confidence intervals for the alternative therapies. RESULTS There are variations in the comparative effectiveness across ethnic groups, with the most notable differences for 9H4R. For unadjusted/absolute effectiveness, 4RIF presents the greatest net benefit for US born black and African patients. For all other ethnic groups, 6H4R was the most effective. CONCLUSION Patient ethnicity affects tolerance to INH. 9H4R was the most effective LTBI treatment for all ethnicities. However, this result heavily depends on whether adjustments are made for self-selection.},

abstract = {SETTING Tertiary care hospital in Kanpur, India. BACKGROUND The need for a standardised treatment protocol for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) in resource-limited countries is being increasingly recognised. OBJECTIVE To assess the effectiveness of high-dose isoniazid (INH) (16-18 mg/kg) adjuvant to second-line therapy in documented cases of MDR-TB. DESIGN The present study is a double blind, randomised controlled trial with three treatment arms, high-dose INH, normal-dose INH and placebo, in addition to second-line drugs. Primary outcomes of the study were time to sputum culture conversion and proportion with sputum culture negative 6 months after treatment initiation. Secondary outcomes were radiological improvement at 1 year post treatment and development of toxicity. RESULTS After adjustment for potential confounders, subjects who received high-dose INH became sputum-negative 2.38 times (95{\%}CI 1.45-3.91, P = 0.001) more rapidly than those who did not receive it, and had a 2.37 times (95{\%}CI 1.46-3.84, P {\textless} 0.001) higher likelihood of being sputum-negative at 6 months. These subjects showed significantly better radiological improvement without an increased risk of INH toxicity. CONCLUSION In low-resource scenarios where a standardised therapeutic protocol is used for MDR-TB, the protocol can be significantly improved by including high-dose INH as an adjuvant.},

Acetylhydrazine was administered i.v. with and without prior ingestion of 300 mg of isoniazid. In the studies with isoniazid, 15N2-acetylhydrazine was administered in order to distinguish exogenous acetylhydrazine from the unlabeled acetylhydrazine formed from isoniazid. In each subject (two fast and three slow acetylators) the rate of elimination of acetylhydrazine was similar to the rate of elimination of isoniazid suggesting that the two compounds are subject to the same acetylation polymorphism. In the presence of isoniazid the rate of elimination of acetylhydrazine was consistently lower than in the absence of isoniazid, and the urinary excretion of diacetylhydrazine and the ratio of diacetyl/acetylhydrazine in urine decreased. The data indicate that therapeutic concentrations of isoniazid and its metabolites inhibit the acetylation of acetylhydrazine in humans.

abstract = {Basolateral efflux is a necessary step in transepithelial (re)absorption of amino acids from small intestine and kidney proximal tubule. The best characterized basolateral amino acid transporters are y+LAT1-4F2hc and LAT2-4F2hc that function as obligatory exchangers and thus, do not contribute to net amino acid (re)absorption. The aromatic amino acid transporter TAT1 was shown previously to localize basolaterally in rat's small intestine and to mediate the efflux of L-Trp in the absence of exchange substrate, upon expression in Xenopus oocytes. We compared here the amino acid influx and efflux via mouse TAT1 in Xenopus oocytes. The results show that mTAT1 functions as facilitated diffusion pathway for aromatic amino acids and that its properties are symmetrical in terms of selectivity and apparent affinity. We show by real-time RT-PCR that its mRNA is highly expressed in mouse small intestine mucosa, kidney, liver, and skeletal muscle as well as present in all other tested tissues. We show that mTAT1 is not N-glycosylated and that it localizes to the mouse kidney proximal tubule. This expression is characterized by an axial gradient similar to that of the luminal neutral amino acid transporter B0AT1 and shows the same basolateral localization as 4F2hc. mTAT1 also localizes to the basolateral membrane of small intestine enterocytes and to the sinusoidal side of perivenous hepatocytes. In summary, we show that TAT1 is a basolateral epithelial transporter and that it can function as a net efflux pathway for aromatic amino acids. We propose that it, thereby, may supply parallel exchangers with recycling uptake substrates that could drive the efflux of other amino acids.},

abstract = {The pharmacokinetics of isoniazid in man are described. Pronounced interindividual variation in circulating isoniazid concentration and clearance which occur after dosing with the drug are associated with hereditary differences in the acetylator status. The variations in rate of isoniazid inactivation and elimination in different (rapid and slow) acetylator phenotypes are primarily due to differences in the rate of acetylation of isoniazid by a genetically controlled polymorphic N-acetyltransferase in liver and small intestine. An appreciable 'first-pass' effect is observed following oral isoniazid administration, particularly in the rapid acetylator phenotype. Liver disease can cause a significant prolongation in the clearance of isoniazid; in the acutely ill patient, the prolongation correlates most closely with serum bilirubin elevation, although the degree of prolongation is less important than the intrinsic genetic difference between acetylator phenotypes. The effect of renal impairment on isoniazid excretion is relatively unimportant, even in slow acetylators. Methods for monitoring blood and urine concentrations of isoniazid and for acetylator phenotype determination which are convenient for the patient and clinician are available. Implications of phenotype differences in acetylator status for the optimal management of tuberculosis with isoniazid are considered. Attempts to devise new isoniazid formulations for this purpose are being evaluated.},

abstract = {Evaluation of sources of pharmacokinetic variation can facilitate optimization of tuberculosis treatment regimens by identification of avoidable sources of variation and of risk factors for low or high drug concentrations in patients. Our objective was to describe the pharmacokinetics of rifampin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol in a cohort of tuberculosis patients established on first-line treatment regimens and to evaluate the determinants of pharmacokinetic variation. Plasma concentration-time profiles were determined for each of the drugs in 142 patients with drug-sensitive pulmonary tuberculosis after 2 months of daily treatment in hospital. Pharmacokinetic measures were described by noncompartmental analysis. Multiple linear regression was used to evaluate the patient and the treatment factors associated with variation of the area under the concentration-time curve from 0 to 8 h. Several factors independently associated with variations in antituberculosis drug concentrations were identified: human immunodeficiency virus infection was associated with 39{\%} and 27{\%} reductions for rifampin and ethambutol, respectively; formulation factors were determinants of rifampin and isoniazid bioavailability; female patients had increased rifampin and isoniazid concentrations but reduced ethambutol concentrations; older patients had higher levels of isoniazid and ethambutol; patients with a history of previous antituberculosis treatment had lower ethambutol concentrations; and the dose per kilogram of body weight was associated with the concentrations of all four agents. Further studies are required to assess the implications of variations in antituberculosis drug concentrations for efficacy and safety before decisions are made to change the dosing strategy in patients at risk.},

abstract = {Plasma concentration-time data for benzoic and hippuric acids and urinary excretion-time data for hippuric acid were analyzed simultaneously after oral doses of 40, 80 or 160 mg/kg sodium benzoate administered at least one week apart to 6 healthy subjects. The mean AUCs of benzoic acid after the doses of 80 and 160 mg/kg of sodium benzoate were 3.7- and 12.0-times greater, respectively, than after 40 mg/kg. However, the mean AUC of hippuric acid was roughly proportional to the benzoate doses. The observed data were explained by a one-compartment model with first-order rate absorption and Michaelis-Menten elimination of benzoic acid, together with a one-compartment model with first-order elimination for hippuric acid. Although the maximum rate of biotransformation of benzoic acid to hippuric acid varied between 17.2 and 28.8 mg.kg-1.h-1 among the six individuals, the mean value (23.0 mg.kg-1.h-1) was fairly close to that provided by daily maximum dose (0.5 g.kg-1.day-1) recommended in the treatment of hyperammonaemia in patients with inborn errors of ureagenesis. The individual maximum rate of metabolism can be estimated from the urinary excretion rate of hippuric acid 1.5 to 3 h after the single oral dose of 80 to 160 mg.kg-1 sodium benzoate. The justification of this concept requires further studies in patients with inborn errors of urea synthesis.},

abstract = {The bioavailabilities of orally administered drugs depend to a great extent on their capability of being transported across the intestinal mucosa. In an attempt to develop an in vitro model for studying the intestinal transport of drugs, we used an intestinal epithelial cell line (Caco 2) derived from a human colon adenocarcinoma. A renal epithelial cell line (MDCK) was also used to determine the tissue specificity of drug transport. These cell lines, which were grown on filters, form a monolayer of well-polarized cells coupled by tight junctions and can be used for transcellular transport experiments. We studied the transport of nine antimicrobial agents with different physicochemical and pharmacokinetic characteristics using these epithelial cell monolayers to determine whether this model could be predictive of oral bioavailability. The transepithelial passage was assayed from the apical (AP) to the basolateral (BL) side and in the opposite direction (BL to AP) in both cell lines. Radioactively labeled mannitol was used to monitor the intactness of the cell monolayer during drug passage. The results indicated that all antimicrobial agents tested tended to behave in vitro generally according to their known in vivo absorptive characteristics. In addition, the use of epithelia from different tissues enabled us to divide the drugs into four groups according to their behaviors and suggested the existence of different transport mechanisms. In particular, two antibiotics, gentamicin and teicoplanin, showed no passage in either direction or cell line, in accordance with their very poor in vivo absorbances after oral administration. In contrast, rifapentine, rifampin, and nalidixic acid passed very efficiently at similar rates in both directions and cell lines in a concentration-dependent, nonsaturable manner, which is suggestive of passive diffusion down a concentration gradient. Of the remaining drugs, isoniazid and novobiocin sodium showed some differences in passage between the two cell lines and, given their ionized state at the pH that was used, may use the paracellular route. Finally, trimethoprim and D-cycloserine exhibited differences in passage both with respect to polarity and cell line; in particular, trimethoprim had a faster rate of passage only in Caco 2 cells and in the BL to AP direction, while D-cycloserine was exclusively transported by Caco 2 cells in the AP to BL direction. In both cases it is possible that active transport mechanisms are involved.},

abstract = {Human N-acetyltransferase 2 (NAT2) is polymorphic in humans and may associate with cancer risk by modifying individual susceptibility to cancers from carcinogen exposure. Since molecular epidemiological studies investigating these associations usually include determining NAT2 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), haplotypes or genotypes, their conclusions can be compromised by the uncertainty of genotype-phenotype relationships. We characterized NAT2 SNPs and haplotypes by cloning and expressing recombinant NAT2 allozymes in mammalian cells. The reference and variant recombinant NAT2 allozymes were characterized for arylamine N-acetylation and O-acetylation of N-hydroxy-arylamines. SNPs and haplotypes that conferred reduced enzymatic activity did so by reducing NAT2 protein without changing NAT2 mRNA levels. Among SNPs that reduced catalytic activity, G191A (R64Q), G590A (R197Q) and G857A (G286E) reduced protein half-life but T341C (I114T), G499A (E167K) and A411T (L137F) did not. G857A (G286E) and the major haplotype possessing this SNP (NAT2 7B) altered the affinity to both substrate and cofactor acetyl coenzyme A, resulting in reduced catalytic activity toward some substrates but not others. Our results suggest that coding region SNPs confer slow acetylator phenotype by multiple mechanisms that also may vary with arylamine exposures.},

abstract = {Acetyl CoA:arylamine N-acetyltransferase (NAT) enzymes catalyze the N-acetylation of aromatic amines and the O-acetylation of aryl hydroxylamines, reactions that govern the disposition and toxicity of many drugs and carcinogens. The human NAT genes and enzymes NAT1 and NAT2 are highly polymorphic and constitute one of the best studied examples of the genetic control of drug metabolism. Naturally occurring human NAT variants provide limited insight into the relationship between NAT amino acid sequence and enzyme activity. We have shown previously that the expression of recombinant NAT2 in bacterial tester strains results in greatly enhanced sensitivity to mutagenic nitroaromatic compounds (which are reduced to aryl hydroxylamines by bacterial enzymes). We hypothesized that random mutagenesis combined with rapid screening could be used to identify functionally significant amino acid residues in NAT enzymes. Pools of NAT2 variants were generated by polymerase chain reaction-mediated random mutagenesis of the complete coding sequence. Reversion induced by a NAT-dependent mutagen, 3-methyl-2-nitroimidazo[4,5-f]quinoline, was used as the basis for screening these pools to identify variants with altered enzyme activity. Eighteen variants were characterized by quantitative mutagenicity assays and enzyme kinetic measurements. This approach can provide new insight into the biochemistry of enzymes involved in the metabolic activation of mutagens.},

abstract = {System L is a major nutrient transport system responsible for the transport of large neutral amino acids including several essential amino acids. We previously identified a transporter (L-type amino acid transporter 1: LAT1) subserving system L in C6 rat glioma cells and demonstrated that LAT1 requires 4F2 heavy chain (4F2hc) for its functional expression. Since its oncofetal expression was suggested in the rat liver, it has been proposed that LAT1 plays a critical role in cell growth and proliferation. In the present study, we have examined the function of human LAT1 (hLAT1) and its expression in human tissues and tumor cell lines. When expressed in Xenopus oocytes with human 4F2hc (h4F2hc), hLAT1 transports large neutral amino acids with high affinity (K(m)= approximately 15- approximately 50 microM) and L-glutamine and L-asparagine with low affinity (K(m)= approximately 1.5- approximately 2 mM). hLAT1 also transports D-amino acids such as D-leucine and D-phenylalanine. In addition, we show that hLAT1 accepts an amino acid-related anti-cancer agent melphalan. When loaded intracellularly, L-leucine and L-glutamine but not L-alanine are effluxed by extracellular substrates, confirming that hLAT1 mediates an amino acid exchange. hLAT1 mRNA is highly expressed in the human fetal liver, bone marrow, placenta, testis and brain. We have found that, while all the tumor cell lines examined express hLAT1 messages, the expression of h4F2hc is varied particularly in leukemia cell lines. In Western blot analysis, hLAT1 and h4F2hc have been confirmed to be linked to each other via a disulfide bond in T24 human bladder carcinoma cells. Finally, in in vitro translation, we show that hLAT1 is not a glycosylated protein even though an N-glycosylation site has been predicted in its extracellular loop, consistent with the property of the classical 4F2 light chain. The properties of the hLAT1/h4F2hc complex would support the roles of this transporter in providing cells with essential amino acids for cell growth and cellular responses, and in distributing amino acid-related compounds.},

abstract = {These studies were designed to assess metabolism of benzidine and N-acetylbenzidine by N-acetyltransferase (NAT) NAT1 and NAT2. Metabolism was assessed using human recombinant NAT1 and NAT2 and human liver slices. For benzidine and N-acetylbenzidine, Km and Vmax values were higher for NAT1 than for NAT2. The clearance ratios (NAT1/NAT2) for benzidine and N-acetylbenzidine were 54 and 535, respectively, suggesting that N-acetylbenzidine is a preferred substrate for NAT1. The much higher NAT1 and NAT2 Km values for N-acetylbenzidine (1380 +/- 90 and 471 +/- 23 microM, respectively) compared to benzidine (254 +/- 38 and 33.3 +/- 1.5 microM, respectively) appear to favor benzidine metabolism over N-acetylbenzidine for low exposures. Determination of these kinetic parameters over a 20-fold range of acetyl-CoA concentrations demonstrated that NAT1 and NAT2 catalyzed N-acetylation of benzidine by a binary ping-pong mechanism. In vitro enzymatic data were correlated to intact liver tissue metabolism using human liver slices. Samples incubated with either [3H]benzidine or [3H]N-acetylbenzidine had a similar ratio of N-acetylated benzidines (N-acetylbenzidine + N',N'-diacetylbenzidine/ benzidine) and produced amounts of N-acetylbenzidine {\textgreater} benzidine {\textgreater} N,N'-diacetylbenzidine. With [3H]benzidine, p-aminobenzoic acid, a NAT1-specific substrate, increased the amount of benzidine and decreased the amount of N-acetylbenzidine produced, resulting in a decreased ratio of acetylated products. This is consistent with benzidine being a NAT1 substrate. N-Acetylation of benzidine or N-acetylbenzidine by human liver slices did not correlate with the NAT2 genotype. However, a higher average acetylation ratio was observed in human liver slices possessing the NAT1*10 compared to the NAT1*4 allele. Thus, a combination of human recombinant NAT and liver slice experiments has demonstrated that benzidine and N-acetylbenzidine are both preferred substrates for NAT1. These results also suggest that NAT1 may exhibit a polymorphic expression in human liver.},

Serum concentrations of INH and acetyl-INH (Ac-INH) were determined spectrophotometrically and by a high-performance liquid chromatographical method, respectively. Peak serum concentrations of INH were achieved earlier and were higher when the drug was taken without food both in the slow and rapid acetylators. Also the areas under drug concentration- time curves were significantly larger after fasting than after any test meal; the dif- ference was most prominent after the carbohydrate meal possibly because INH can form unabsorbable condensation products with various sugars. Elimination half-lives of INH were significantly longer in the slow acetylators than in the rapid. Serum acetyl-INH levels were always about twice as high in the rapid acetylators than in the slow. The effect of food on acetyl-INH levels was similar. The rate and extent of absorption of INH from one 300 mg and six 50 mg tablets were not significantly different. Introduction},

The lactulose/mannitol urinary excretion test (L/M), normally used to measure intestinal permeability, may be useful to assess drug absorption. The objective of this research was to study intestinal absorptive function and bioavailability of rifampin and isoniazid in TB patients. A cross sectional study was done with 41 patients and 28 healthy controls, using the L/M test. The bioavailabilities of rifampin (R) and isoniazid (H) were evaluated in 18 patients receiving full doses. Urinary excretion of mannitol and lactulose, measured by HPLC, was significantly lower in TB patients. The serum concentrations of the drugs were below the expected range for R (8-24 mcg/mL) or H (3-6 mcg/mL) in 16/18 patients. Analyzing the drugs individually, 12/18 patients had low serum concentrations of R, 13/18 for H and 8/18 for both drugs. We suggest that there is a decrease in the functional absorptive area of the intestine in TB patients, which would explain the reduced serum concentrations of antituberculosis drugs. There is a need for new approaches to improve drug bioavailability in TB patients.},

abstract = {Since isoniazid is increasingly being used to control the spread of tuberculosis, physicians must be aware of its potentially fatal effects. The ingestion of toxic amounts of isoniazid causes recurrent seizures, profound metabolic acidosis, coma and even death. In adults, toxicity can occur with the acute ingestion of as little as 1.5 g of isoniazid. Doses larger than 30 mg per kg often produce seizures. When ingested in amounts of 80 to 150 mg per kg or more, isoniazid can be rapidly fatal. The first signs and symptoms of isoniazid toxicity usually appear 30 minutes to two hours after ingestion and include nausea, vomiting, slurred speech, dizziness, tachycardia and urinary retention, followed by stupor, coma and recurrent grand mal seizures. The seizures produced by isoniazid toxicity are often refractory to anticonvulsant therapy. Given in gram-per-gram amounts of the isoniazid ingested, pyridoxine (vitamin B6) usually eliminates seizure activity and helps to correct the patient's metabolic acidosis. Isoniazid toxicity should be suspected in any patient who presents with refractory seizures and metabolic acidosis.},

abstract = {AIMS To define the pharmacokinetics of isoniazid (INH) in children with tuberculosis in relation to the N-acetyltransferase 2 (NAT2) genotype. METHODS The first order elimination rate constant (k) and area under the concentration curve (AUC) were calculated in 64 children {\textless}13 years of age (median 3.8) with respiratory tuberculosis from INH concentrations determined 2-5 hours after a 10 mg/kg INH dose. The NAT2 genotype was determined; 25 children were classified as homozygous slow (SS), 24 as heterozygous fast (FS), and 15 as homozygous fast (FF) acetylators. RESULTS The mean (SD) k values of the genotypes differed significantly from one another: SS 0.254 (0.046), FS 0.513 (0.074), FF 0.653 (0.117). Within each genotype a median regression of k on age showed a significant decrease in k with age. The mean (SD) INH concentrations (mg/l) two hours after INH administration were SS 8.599 (1.974), FS 5.131 (1.864), and FF 3.938 (1.754). A within genotype regression of 2-hour INH concentrations on age showed a significant increase with age. A within genotype regression of 3-hour, 4-hour, and 5-hour concentrations on age also showed a significant increase with age in each instance. In ethnically similar adults, mean (SD) 2-hour INH concentrations (mg/l) for each genotype were significantly higher than the children's: SS 10.942 (1.740), FS 8.702 (1.841), and FF 6.031 (1.431). CONCLUSIONS Younger children eliminate INH faster than older children and, as a group, faster than adults, and require a higher mg/kg body weight INH dose to achieve serum concentrations comparable to adults.},

abstract = {To describe the clinical and demographic characteristics of fatal hepatitis due to single-drug isoniazid preventive therapy for tuberculosis, we did a survey of cases from state health departments, published case reports, and reports to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from 1970 to 1992. Of 108 reported cases, some clinical information was available for 76. A medical review panel judged 39 of these deaths as probably due to isoniazid hepatitis and 23 deaths as possibly due to isoniazid hepatitis. Of the 62 probable and possible cases combined, 50 (81{\%}) were female, 49 (79{\%}) were non-Hispanic black or Hispanic, and 19 (31{\%}) were younger than 35 years. The median duration of isoniazid preventive therapy before symptom onset was 16 weeks. Of the 60 cases with symptom information, 54 (90{\%}) presented with jaundice. Of the 62 cases, 26 (42{\%}) were monitored monthly in accordance with current recommendations, and 6 of the patients were younger than 35 years. We estimate that the rate of fatal isoniazid hepatitis among patients in the public sector was no greater than 4.2 per 100,000 persons beginning therapy and no greater than 7 per 100,000 persons completing therapy. Adherence to isoniazid preventive therapy guidelines apparently reduces, but does not eliminate, the risk of fatal hepatitis. Careful patient selection, education, and monitoring are critical for minimizing that risk.},

The results derived from tissue cytosol showed that 12 rapid, ten intermediate and eight slow acetylators based on p-aminobenzoic acid and 2-aminofluorene for substrates. The mean apparent K(m) values for the monomorphic substrate p-aminobenzoic acid and polymorphic substrate 2-aminofluorene were: 55.0 ± 18.7, 114.0 ± 30.0, and 137.0 ± 37.2 $\mu$M; and 62.5 ± 23.7, 166.0 ± 67.0, and 239.0 ± 76.6 $\mu$M for the slow, intermediate, and rapid enzymes, respectively. Compared to the enzymes from slow acetylators, the rapid acetylators exhibited mean apparent V(max) values eight- and ten-fold greater for p-aminobenzoic acid and 2-aminofluorene, respectively. A similar trend was obtained from the blood cytosols of cancerous patients and healthy volunteers. N-Acetyltransferase activity of breast cancerous and non-cancerous tissues were 1.5- and 2.2-fold different between rapid and slow acetylator with p-aminobenzoic acid and 2-aminofluorene as substrates, respectively. In breast cancerous tissues, 75{\%} and 70{\%} of the cytosolic N-acetyltransferase activity were inhibited under 2 mM of tamoxifen as substrates of 2-aminofluorene and p-aminobenzoic acid, respectively. Similar results were also found in non-cancerous tissues and blood samples from breast cancer patients and healthy volunteers. The effect of 1 mM tamoxifen on the N-acetyltransferase activity from breast cancerous tissues with positive estrogen receptor was 1.6-fold higher than that of negative estrogen receptor. This is the first demonstration to show that anti-estrogen drug can affect N-acetyltransferase activity in breast cancerous tissues. Therefore, this finding may provide a clue to the use of tamoxifen in prevention of human breast cancer.},

In a first study normal healthy subjects and patients with chronic liver disease received, on three different occasions, a single dose of 600 mg rifampicin or isoniazid and of rifampicin and isoniazid associated in randomized sequences. The results have shown that in both groups the serum levels, half-life values, and urinary excretion of each drug given alone are not significantly different from those observed when the other drug is associated. Serum levels and half-life of rifampicin and isoniazid were significantly higher in patients with chronically impaired liver. In a second study, rifampicin and isoniazid were given in combination at the same doses as in the first study over a period of one week. The results have shown a trend to decrease in the serum levels of rifampicin of the healthy subjects and a trend to increase in the patients with chronic liver disease on day 7 of treatment. In both groups a reduction in the half-life of rifampicin was also observed. No changes in serum isoniazid concentrations were observed between day 1 and day 7 in the healthy subjects, whereas a significant increase was observed in the patients.

abstract = {This study reports on the functional expression of a specific, high-affinity carrier-mediated mechanism for the transport of niacin (nicotinic acid) in human liver cells. Both human-derived liver HepG2 cells and human primary hepatocytes were used as models in these investigations. The initial rate of transport of nicotinic acid into HepG2 cells was found to be acidic pH, temperature, and energy dependent; it was, however, Na(+) independent in nature. Evidence for the existence of a carrier-mediated system that is specific for [(3)H]nicotinic acid transport was found and included the following: 1) saturability as a function of concentration with an apparent K(m) of 0.73 +/- 0.16 microM and V(max) of 25.02 +/- 1.45 pmol.mg protein(-1).3 min(-1), 2) cis-inhibition by unlabeled nicotinic acid and nicotinamide but not by unrelated organic anions (lactate, acetate, butyrate, succinate, citrate, and valproate), and 3) trans-stimulation of [(3)H]nicotinic acid efflux by unlabeled nicotinic acid. Transport of the vitamin into human primary hepatocytes occurs similarly via an acidic pH-dependent and specific carrier-mediated process. Inhibitors of the Ca(2+)-calmodulin-mediated pathway (but not modulators of the PKC-, PKA-, and protein tyrosine kinase-mediated pathways) inhibited nicotinic acid transport into both HepG2 cells and human primary hepatocytes. Maintenance of HepG2 cells (for 48 h) in growth medium oversupplemented with nicotinic acid (or nicotinamide) did not affect the subsequent transport of [(3)H]nicotinic acid into HepG2 cells. These results show, for the first time, the existence of a specific and regulated membrane carrier-mediated system for nicotinic acid transport in human liver cells.},

abstract = {Human polymorphic N-acetyltransferase (NAT2) catalyzes the N-acetylation of arylamine carcinogens and the metabolic activation of N-hydroxyarylamine and N-hydroxyarylamide carcinogens by O- and N,O-acetylation, respectively. Rapid and slow acetylator phenotype is regulated at the NAT2 locus, and each has been associated with differential risk to certain cancers relating to carcinogenic arylamine exposures. We examined arylamine N-acetylation, N-hydroxyarylamine O-acetylation, and N-hydroxyarylamide N,O-acetylation catalytic activities of 16 different recombinant human NAT2 alleles expressed in an Escherichia coli JM105 expression system. NAT2 alleles contained nucleic acid substitutions at G191A (Arg64--{\textgreater}Gln), C282T (silent), T341C (Ile114--{\textgreater}Thr), C481T (silent), G590A (Arg197--{\textgreater}Gln), A803G (Lys268--{\textgreater}Arg), G857A (Gly286--{\textgreater}Glu), and various combinations of substitutions in the 870-bp NAT2-coding region. Expression of each NAT2 allele produced equivalent amounts of immunoreactive recombinant NAT2 protein with differential levels of N-, O-, and N,O-acetylation activity. Catalytic activities of each of the recombinant human NAT2 allozymes followed the relative order N-acetylation {\textgreater} O-acetylation {\textgreater} N,O-acetylation. Catalytic activation rates for the metabolic activation of N-hydroxy-2-aminofluorene and N-hydroxy-4-aminobiphenyl by O-acetylation and N-hydroxy-2-acetylaminofluorene by N,O-acetylation showed very strong correlations to the N-acetylation of 2-aminofluorene. NAT2 alleles with nucleic acid substitution T341C (NAT2*5A,*5B,*5C) expressed recombinant NAT2 allozymes, with the greatest reductions in metabolic activation of N-hydroxyarylamines and N-hydroxyarylamides by O- and N,O-acetylation, respectively. NAT2 alleles with nucleic acid substitutions G191A (NAT2*14A,*14B) and G590A (NAT2*6A,*6B) expressed recombinant NAT2 allozymes with more moderate reductions. NAT2 alleles with nucleic acid substitution G857A (NAT2*7A,*7B) expressed recombinant NAT2 allozymes with the smallest but yet significant reductions. NAT2 alleles with nucleic acid substitutions C282T (silent), C481T (silent), and A803G (Lys268--{\textgreater}Arg) expressed recombinant NAT2 allozymes that did not have significant reductions in the metabolic activations of N-hydroxyarylamines and N-hydroxyarylamides. The differential capacity for the metabolic activation of N-hydroxyarylamines and N-hydroxyarylamides by recombinant human NAT2 allozymes encoded by polymorphic NAT2 alleles supports the hypothesis that acetylator phenotype may predispose to cancers related to activation of N-hydroxy-arylamine and N-hydroxyarylamide carcinogens.},

abstract = {The current treatment regimen against drug susceptible tuberculosis (DS-TB) was defined by the 1980s. Since then the emergence of the global HIV pandemic and the escalation of drug resistant (DR-) forms of TB have presented new challenges for therapeutic research. Priority goals include shortening DS-TB treatment, improving DR-TB treatment and making combined TB-HIV therapy easier. To help achieve these goals, a range of new drugs and treatment strategies are currently being evaluated. Phase IIb and III clinical trials are ongoing to assess combinations involving the high-dose rifamycins, the 8-methoxyquinolones, a diarylquinoline (bedaquiline) and the nitroimidazoles. Other compounds (e.g. novel oxazolidinones and ethylenediamines) are at earlier stages of clinical development. Overall, there are grounds for optimism that recent advances will contribute towards achievement of new treatment regimens in the foreseeable future. However, long-term investment, political commitment and scientific endeavour are crucial to ensure that progress is sustained and the benefits of recent advances reach those in the greatest need. {\textcopyright} 2013 Bentham Science Publishers.},

There are drugs that are currently used in the clinic for which individualized therapy could be beneficial based on PGx data. However, specific, actionable recommendations on how to implement individualized therapy--particularly with respect to dosage--still have to be developed. Moreover, to apply PGx efficiently in clinical drug development, and later in drug therapy, study designs and the generation and handling of PGx data need to become more standardized. Here, we argue for the development of concise guidelines for implementation of PGx analyses in drug development and therapy},

abstract = {To test the hypothesis that antituberculous drug disposition is altered in patients with AIDS, we studied the steady-state pharmacokinetics of isoniazid (300 mg/d), rifampin (600 mg/d), and pyrazinamide (1,500 mg/d) in 29 adults (14 patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus [HIV] and 15 non-HIV-infected patients) with tuberculosis in Nairobi, Kenya. Intestinal integrity was assessed with xylose. Neither HIV infection nor diarrhea accounted for the interpatient variability in the area-under-the-plasma concentration vs. time curve (AUC), the maximum concentration, or the terminal half-life (t1/2) of isoniazid, rifampin, and pyrazinamide. No significant association between HIV infection or diarrhea and pharmacokinetics was seen for any of the compounds. In addition, neither the AUC nor the t1/2 of any of these drugs reflected interpatient differences in CD4 lymphocyte counts. Xylose absorption was uniformly low. We did not demonstrate that HIV infection, diarrhea, or CD4 lymphocyte counts contributed significantly to the variability in pharmacokinetics of isoniazid, rifampin, and pyrazinamide in TB patients in Nairobi.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater} Limited data address the impact of HIV coinfection on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of antituberculosis drugs in sub-Saharan Africa. A total of 47 Malawian adults underwent rich pharmacokinetic sampling at 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, and 24 h postdose. Of the subjects, 51{\%} were male, their mean age was 34 years, and 65{\%} were HIV-positive with a mean CD4 count of 268 cells/$\mu$l. Antituberculosis drugs were administered as fixed-dose combinations (150 mg rifampin, 75 mg isoniazid, 400 mg pyrazinamide, and 275 mg ethambutol) according to recommended weight bands. Plasma drug concentrations were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography (rifampin and pyrazinamide) or liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (isoniazid and ethambutol). Data were analyzed by noncompartmental methods and analysis of variance of log-transformed summary parameters. The pharmacokinetic parameters were as follows (median [interquartile range]): for rifampin, maximum concentration of drug in plasma ( {\textless}italic{\textgreater}C{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} {\textless}sub{\textgreater}max{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} ) of 4.129 $\mu$g/ml (2.474 to 5.596 $\mu$g/ml), area under the curve from 0 to 24 h (AUC {\textless}sub{\textgreater}0–∞{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} ) of 21.32 $\mu$g/ml {\textperiodcentered} h (13.57 to 28.60 $\mu$g/ml {\textperiodcentered} h), and half-life of 2.45 h (1.86 to 3.08 h); for isoniazid, {\textless}italic{\textgreater}C{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} {\textless}sub{\textgreater}max{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} of 3.97 $\mu$g/ml (2.979 to 4.544 $\mu$g/ml), AUC {\textless}sub{\textgreater}0–24{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} of 22.5 (14.75 to 34.59 $\mu$g/ml {\textperiodcentered} h), and half-life of 3.93 h (3.18 to 4.73 h); for pyrazinamide, {\textless}italic{\textgreater}C{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} {\textless}sub{\textgreater}max{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} of 34.21 $\mu$g/ml (30.00 to 41.60 $\mu$g/ml), AUC {\textless}sub{\textgreater}0–24{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} of 386.6 $\mu$g/ml {\textperiodcentered} h (320.0 to 463.7 $\mu$g/ml {\textperiodcentered} h), and half-life of 6.821 h (5.71 to 8.042 h); and for ethambutol, {\textless}italic{\textgreater}C{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} {\textless}sub{\textgreater}max{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} of 2.278 $\mu$g/ml (1.694 to 3.098 $\mu$g/ml), AUC {\textless}sub{\textgreater}0–24{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} of 20.41 $\mu$g/ml {\textperiodcentered} h (16.18 to 26.27 $\mu$g/ml {\textperiodcentered} h), and half-life of 7.507 (6.517 to 8.696 h). The isoniazid PK data analysis suggested that around two-thirds of the participants were slow acetylators. Dose, weight, and weight-adjusted dose were not significant predictors of PK exposure, probably due to weight-banded dosing. In this first pharmacokinetic study of antituberculosis drugs in Malawian adults, measures of pharmacokinetic exposure were comparable with those of other studies for all first-line drugs except for rifampin, for which the {\textless}italic{\textgreater}C{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} {\textless}sub{\textgreater}max{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} and AUC {\textless}sub{\textgreater}0–24{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} values were notably lower. Contrary to some earlier observations, HIV status did not significantly affect the AUC of any of the drugs. Increasing the dose of rifampin might be beneficial in African adults, irrespective of HIV status. Current co-trimoxazole prophylaxis was associated with an increase in the half-life of isoniazid of 41{\%} ( {\textless}italic{\textgreater}P{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} = 0.022). Possible competitive interactions between isoniazid and sulfamethoxazole mediated by the {\textless}italic{\textgreater}N{\textless}/italic{\textgreater} -acetyltransferase pathway should therefore be explored further. {\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {Detailed pharmacokinetic studies undertaken on a slow and a rapid acetylator of isoniazid enabled approximate first-order rate constants to be calculated for the metabolic processes involved in the conversion of isoniazid to acetylisoniazid, isonicotinic acid, isonicotinylglycine, monoacetylhydrazine, and diacetylhydrazine, and their excretion in the urine. Further studies of the metabolism of isoniazid were carried out on another 17 slow and 11 rapid acetylators. The major pathway of isoniazid metabolism was acetylation. The rapid acetylators acetylated isoniazid 5-6 times more rapidly than the slow acetylators. Acid-labile hydrazones were also formed, and some isoniazid was hydrolyzed directly to isonicotinic acid. The major metabolic route for the formation of isonicotinic acid from isoniazid was via acetylisoniazid. Cleavage of acetylisoniazid in the body resulted in the formation of monoacetylhydrazine, which was then acetylated polymorphically to diacetylhydrazine in a manner analogous to the acetylation of isoniazid. Individuals differed in their ability to conjugate isonicotinic acid with glycine, and these differences were unrelated to the rates at which isoniazid was acetylated. The conjugation of isonicotinic acid with glycine and the acetylation of isoniazid appeared to be partially saturated in vivo after the administration of doses of as little as 250 mg of either compound.},

abstract = {The World Health Organization (WHO) recently issued revised first-line antituberculosis (anti-TB) drug dosage recommendations for children. No pharmacokinetic studies for these revised dosages are available for children {\textless}2 years. The aim of the study was to document the pharmacokinetics of the first-line anti-TB agents in children {\textless}2 years of age comparing previous and revised WHO dosages of isoniazid (INH; 5 versus 10 mg/kg/day), rifampin (RMP; 10 versus 15 mg/kg/day), and pyrazinamide (PZA; 25 versus 35 mg/kg/day) and to investigate the effects of clinical covariates, including HIV coinfection, nutritional status, age, gender, and type of tuberculosis (TB), and the effect of NAT2 acetylator status. Serum INH, PZA, and RMP levels were prospectively assessed in 20 children {\textless}2 years of age treated for TB following the previous and the revised WHO dosage recommendations. Samples were taken prior to dosing and at 0.5, 1.5, 3, and 5 h following dosing. The maximum drug concentration in serum (C(max)), the time to C(max) (t(max)), and the area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) were calculated. Eleven children had pulmonary and 9 had extrapulmonary TB. Five were HIV infected. The mean C(max) ($\mu$g/ml) following the administration of previous/revised dosages were as follows: INH, 3.19/8.11; RMP, 6.36/11.69; PZA, 29.94/47.11. The mean AUC ($\mu$g{\textperiodcentered}h/ml) were as follows: INH, 8.09/20.36; RMP, 17.78/36.95; PZA, 118.0/175.2. The mean C(max) and AUC differed significantly between doses. There was no difference in the t(max) values achieved. Children less than 2 years of age achieve target concentrations of first-line anti-TB agents using revised WHO dosage recommendations. Our data provided supportive evidence for the implementation of the revised WHO guidelines for first-line anti-TB therapy in young children.},

abstract = {A fluorescent derivative of D-glucose, 2-NBDG, which was previously developed for the evaluation of glucose uptake activity by living cells, was used on Escherichia coli cells and its fate after incorporation in the cells was investigated. 2-NBDG was converted to another fluorescent derivative (2-NBDG metabolite) immediately after it was taken by E. coli cells. This 2-NBDG metabolite was then decomposed to non-fluorescent forms. 2-NBDG metabolite was decomposed into the original 2-NBDG by G6Pase with concurrent liberation of inorganic phosphate. Furthermore, FAB/MS analysis showed that its molecular weight was 420, the same value as that of 2-NBDG 6-phosphate. These indicate 2-NBDG metabolite should be 2-NBDG 6-phosphate. Based on these results, the feasibility of 2-NBDG as a fluorescent non-toxic probe for glucose uptake activity and its application to viability assessment of various living systems are discussed.},

SLC16A10 (T-type amino-acid transporter-1, TAT1) is an aromatic amino acid transporter whilst the other members await characterization. MCTs have 12 transmembrane domains (TMDs) with intracellular N- and C-termini and a large intracellular loop between TMDs 6 and 7. MCT1 and MCT4 require a monotopic ancillary protein, CD147, for expression of functional protein at the plasma membrane. Lactic acid transport across the plasma membrane is fundamental for the metabolism of and pH regulation of all cells, removing lactic acid produced by glycolysis and allowing uptake by those cells utilizing it for gluconeogenesis (liver and kidney) or as a respiratory fuel (heart and red muscle). The properties of the different MCT isoforms and their tissue distribution and regulation reflect these roles.},

Bovine and human liver benzoyl-amino acid conjugation were investigated using electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (ESI-MS-MS). Bovine glycine N-acyltransferase catalyzed conjugation of benzoyl-CoA with Gly (Km(Gly) = 6.2 mM), Asn (Km(Asn) = 129 mM), Gln (Km(Gln) = 353 mM), Ala (Km(Ala) = 1573 mM), Glu (Km(Glu) = 1148 mM) as well as Ser in a sequential mechanism. In the case of the human form, conjugation with Gly (Km(Gly) = 6.4 mM), Ala (Km(Ala) = 997 mM), and Glu was detected. The presence of these alternative conjugates did not inhibit bovine glycine N-acyltransferase activity significantly. Considering the relatively low levels at which these conjugates are formed, it is unlikely that they will have a significant contribution to acyl-amino acid conjugation under normal conditions in vivo. However, their cumulative contribution to acyl-amino acid conjugation under metabolic disease states may prove to have a useful contribution to detoxification of elevated acyl-CoAs.},

abstract = {The World Health Organization's Stop TB Department has prepared this fourth edition of Treatment of Tuberculosis: Guidelines, adhering fully to the new WHO process for evidence-based guidelines. Several important recommendations are being promoted in this new edition.First, the recommendation to discontinue the regimen based on just 2 months of rifampicin (2HRZE/6HE) and change to the regimen based on a full 6 months of rifampicin (2HRZE/4HR) will reduce the number of relapses and failures. This will alleviate patient suffering resulting from a second episode of tuberculosis (TB) and conserve patient and programme resources.Second, this fourth edition confirms prior WHO recommendations for drug susceptibility testing (DST) at the start of therapy for all previously treated patients. Finding and treating multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) in previously treated patients will help to improve the very poor outcomes in these patients. New recommendations for the prompt detection and appropriate treatment of (MDR-TB) cases will also improve access to life-saving care.Third, detecting MDR-TB will require expansion of DST capacity within the context of country-specific, comprehensive plans for laboratory strengthening. This fourth edition provides guidance for treatment approaches in the light of advances in laboratory technology and the country's progress in building laboratory capacity.Fourth, diagnosing MDR-TB cases among previously treated patients and providing effective treatment will greatly help in halting the spread of MDR-TB. This edition also addresses the prevention of acquired MDR-TB, especially among new TB patients who already have isoniazid-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis when they start treatment.Finally, this edition strongly reaffirms prior recommendations for supervised treatment, as well as the use of fixed-dose combinations of anti-TB drugs and patient kits as further measures for preventing the acquisition of drug resistance.},

@article{Parkin1997,
abstract = {The study was undertaken to show that polymorphic isoniazid elimination in humans is trimodal; that the acetylator genotype and eliminator phenotype of the individual patient are concordant; and that the differences in the pharmacokinetic parameters of fast, intermediate, and slow eliminator subgroups are statistically significant. Sixty adult patients of both sexes and of mixed race with tuberculosis participated in the trial. The apparent elimination rate constant (k, h(-1)) and the area under the isoniazid concentration-time curve (AUC, mg/L/h), over the interval 2 to 6 h after oral isoniazid were determined in all patients; NAT2 allele composition was determined in 47 patients. Serum INH concentrations were determined by HPLC and genotypes by PCR/restriction enzyme analysis. Three eliminator phenotypes could be distinguished, and concordance between the phenotype and the genotype of the individual could be demonstrated. The isoniazid concentration-time profiles of the three eliminator subgroups were significantly different (p {\textless} 0.05). The NAT2*12A allele, which codes for fast acetylation, has a high frequency in the population studied, the intermediate acetylator genotype is constituted of codominant fast and slow alleles, and the distribution of phenotypes/genotypes in the population is consistent with Hardy-Weinberg predictions. The therapeutic implications of polymorphic isoniazid metabolism are discussed.},

@article{Mariotta2012,
abstract = {The uniporter TAT1 (Slc16a10) mediates the facilitated diffusion of aromatic amino acids (AAAs) across basolateral membranes of kidney, small intestine and liver epithelial cells, and across the plasma membrane of non-epithelial cells like skeletal myocytes. Its role for body AA homeostasis has now been investigated using newly generated TAT1 (Slc16a10) defective mice (tat1(-/-)). These mice grow and reproduce normally, show no gross phenotype and no obvious neurological defect. Histological analysis did not reveal abnormalities and there is no compensatory change in any tested AA transporter mRNA. TAT1 null mice, however, display increased plasma, muscle and kidney AAA concentration under both normal and high protein diet, although this concentration remains normal in the liver. A major aromatic aminoaciduria and a smaller urinary loss of all substrates additionally transported by l-type AA antiporter Lat2-4F2hc (Slc7a8) were revealed under a high protein diet. This suggests an epithelial transport defect as also shown by the accumulation of intravenously injected (123)I-2-I-l-Phe in kidney and l-[(3)H]Phe in ex vivo everted gut sac enterocytes. Taken together, these data indicate that the uniporter TAT1 is required to equilibrate the concentration of AAAs across specific membranes. For instance, it enables hepatocytes to function as a sink that controls the extracellular AAAs concentration. Additionally, it facilitates the release of AAAs across the basolateral membrane of small intestine and proximal kidney tubule epithelial cells, thereby allowing the efflux of other neutral AAs presumably via Lat2-4F2hc.},

@article{Hand1984,
abstract = {To provide additional criteria for therapy of pulmonary infections caused by facultative intracellular bacteria, we studied the uptake of 12 antibiotics by alveolar macrophages (AM) obtained from healthy, young volunteers by bronchoalveolar lavage. These human AM were incubated with radiolabeled antibiotics for periods as long as 2 h. Entry of antimicrobials into the cells was determined by means of a velocity-gradient centrifugation technique. Antibiotic uptake was expressed as the ratio of the cellular to the extracellular drug concentration (C/E). Penicillin G, cefamandole, and gentamicin were taken up poorly by human AM (C/E = 0.5 to 0.8). Isoniazid achieved a cellular concentration similar to the extracellular level of the drug (C/E = 0.9). Chloramphenicol, rifampin, tetracycline, and lincomycin, drugs that are lipid-soluble, were concentrated several-fold by AM (C/E = 2 to 5). The remaining antibiotics tested, clindamycin, erythromycin, erythromycin propionate, and ethambutol, were markedly concentrated by AM (C/E = 9 to 23). Accumulation of clindamycin (C/E = 23) was a rapid, active, energy-requiring process, which appeared to be dependent upon mitochondrial oxidative metabolism. The ability of the tested antimicrobial agents to enter human AM correlates well with the efficacy of these drugs in treatment of certain intracellular pulmonary infections.},
