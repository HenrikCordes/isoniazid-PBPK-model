abstract = {Studies in rats indicate that the metabolic activation of acetylhydrazine, a metabolite of isoniazid, is a critical determinant of the hepatotoxicity of isoniazid. As demonstrated in that model, the formation of 14CO2 after the administration of 14C-acetylisoniazid reflects the activity of the toxic pathway. A similar approach in man should make it possible to demonstrate the presence and to assess the quantitative importance of this toxifying pathway, and thus to evaluate its role in the pathogenesis of isoniazid hepatitis. We gave 300 mg isoniazid together with 10 microCi 14C-acetylisoniazid (12 mg) to 17 healthy subjects and determined the time course of the plasma concentrations of isoniazid, acetylisoniazid, acetylhydrazine, and diacetylhydrazine and of the exhalation of 14CO2. The time course of 14CO2 in breath closely paralleled the plasma concentration-time curve of acetylhydrazine but not those of acetylisoniazid or diacetylhydrazine, indicating that the 14CO2 originated directly from the metabolism of acetylhydrazine. The cumulative exhalation of 14CO2 increased with decreasing rate of acetylation of isoniazid, such that slow acetylators generated more 14CO2 than rapid acetylators. Simulation studies demonstrated that even if the data are corrected for the different formation of acetylisoniazid from isoniazid in slow and rapid acetylators, the slow acetylators still generated more 14CO2. The data therefore indicate that a substantial fraction of the acetylhydrazine formed from isoniazid passes through a pathway that has been shown in animals to generate highly reactive and hepatotoxic intermediates.},

abstract = {In the pathogenesis of isoniazid-induced hepatic injury, cytochrome P450-dependent metabolic activation of the metabolite, acetylhydrazine (AcHz), is the crucial step. Exhalation of [14C]-carbon dioxide has previously been used to quantify indirectly this pathway. In contrast, according to the current concept of AcHz bioactivation, molecular nitrogen is produced directly, but has not yet been identified. Here, we measured [15N]-nitrogen and 14CO2 exhalation, after the administration of [15N2]-[14C]-AcHz, in rats. Laser magnetic resonance (LMR) spectroscopy, a new sensitive and specific technique for the measurement of 15N and 14N in gas samples, was used. To demonstrate the involvement of cytochrome P450, rats were treated with phenobarbital (PB) or PB+cobalt(II) chloride (CoCl2) (n = 3 in each group). Time-dependent 15N2 exhalation differed significantly between treatment groups (p {\textless} 0.001). At 240 min, cumulative exhalation of 15N was 1.92 +/- 0.43{\%} (mean +/- SE) of the dose in the control group, 2.53 +/- 0.23{\%} in the PB group, and 1.00 +/- 0.15{\%} in the PB+CoCl2 group (p {\textless} 0.05 compared to controls, p {\textless} 0.01 compared to PB). Cumulative exhalation of 14CO2 in 24 h ranged from 15.1 to 21.9{\%}, with no significant difference between treatment groups. In conclusion, N2 is a metabolite of AcHz. N2 formation reflects the cytochrome P450-mediated activation of AcHz and can be used as an index of this pathway. Generally, LMR spectroscopy is valuable for monitoring any N2-liberating process in vivo.},

abstract = {15N-NMR has been used to study the metabolism of hydrazine in rats in vivo. Single doses of [15N2]hydrazine (2.0 mmol/kg: 98.6{\%} g atom) were administered to rats and urine collected for 24 hr over ice. A number of metabolites were detected by 15N-NMR analysis of lyophilized urine. Ammonia was detected as a singlet at 0 ppm and unchanged [15N2]hydrazine was present in the urine detectable as a singlet at 32 ppm. Peaks were observed at 107 and 110 ppm which were identified as being due to the hydrazido nitrogen of acetylhydrazine and diacetylhydrazine, respectively. A resonance at 85 ppm was ascribed to carbazic acid, resulting from reaction of hydrazine with carbon dioxide. A singlet detected at 316 ppm was thought to be due to the hydrazono nitrogen of the pyruvate hydrazone. The resonance at 56 ppm was assigned to 15N-enriched urea, this together with the presence of ammonia indicates that the N-N bond of hydrazine is cleaved in vivo, possibly by N-oxidation, and the resultant ammonia is incorporated into urea. A doublet centred at 150 ppm and a singlet at 294 ppm were assigned to a metabolite which results from cyclization of the 2-oxoglutarate hydrazone. Therefore 15N-NMR spectroscopic analysis of urine has yielded significant new information on the metabolism of hydrazine.},

abstract = {Hydrazine is a model toxin that induces both hepatotoxic and neurotoxic effects in experimental animals. The direct biochemical effects of hydrazine in kidney, liver, and brain tissue were assessed in male Sprague-Dawley rats using magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. A single dose of hydrazine (90 mg/kg) resulted in changes to the biochemical composition of the liver after 24 h including an increase in triglycerides and beta-alanine, together with a decrease in hepatic glycogen, glucose, choline, taurine, and trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO). From histopathology measurements of liver tissue, minimal to mild hepatocyte alteration was observed in all animals at 24 h. The NMR spectra of the renal cortex at 24 h after dosing were dominated by a marked increase in the tissue concentration of 2-aminoadipate (2-AA) and beta-alanine, concomitant with depletions in TMAO, myo-inositol, choline, taurine, glutamate, and lysine. No alteration to the NMR spectral profile of the substantia nigra was observed after hydrazine administration, but perturbations to the relative concentrations of creatine, aspartate, myo-inositol, and N-acetyl aspartate were apparent in the hippocampus of hydrazine-treated animals at 24 h postdose. No overt signs of histopathological toxicity were observed in either the kidney or the brain regions examined. Elevated alanine levels were observed in all tissues indicative of a general inhibition of alanine transaminase activity. By 168 h postdose, NMR spectral profiles of treated rats appeared similar to those of matched controls for all tissue types indicative of recovery from toxic insult.},

The hepatotoxicity of AcHD and HD were compared in adult male C57Bl/6J mice by evaluating hepatic histopathology, plasma biochemistry, and hepatic gene expression. By all measures, HD had significantly greater effects than AcHD. There was no evidence of liver damage following exposure to AcHD (300 mg/kg, po). However, HD at this dose caused marked hepatic necrosis, macrovesicular degeneration, and steatosis. Lipid accumulation was initiated 2 h after HD exposure, with hepatic macrovesicular degeneration evident after 4 h, and severe necrosis by 36 h. Gene expression profiles were compared 24 h following 100 mg/kg po of HD or AcHD. HD changed the hepatic expression of more genes than AcHD, particularly lipid synthesis, transport, and metabolism genes that may be involved in steatosis. Hepatic expression of genes regulated by peroxisome proliferator activated receptors (PPAR) and sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP) transcription factors was increased only by HD. The hepatotoxicty and hepatic gene expression profile of HD, but not AcHD, indicate that exposure to HD initiates a process whereby the production and intracellular transport of hepatic lipids is favored over the removal of fatty acids and their metabolites.},

abstract = {Most cases with antituberculosis drug-induced hepatitis have been attributed to isoniazid. Isoniazid is metabolized by hepatic N-acetyltransferase (NAT) and cytochrome P450 2E1 (CYP2E1) to form hepatotoxins. However, the role of CYP2E1 in this hepatotoxicity has not yet been reported. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether the polymorphism of the CYP2E1 gene is associated with antituberculosis drug-induced hepatitis. A total of 318 tuberculosis patients who received antituberculosis treatment were followed prospectively. Their CYP2E1 and NAT2 genotypes were determined using a polymerase chain reaction with restriction fragment length polymorphism method. Twenty-one healthy volunteers were recruited for CYP2E1 phenotype study using a chlorzoxazone test. Forty-nine (15.4{\%}) patients were diagnosed to have drug-induced hepatotoxicity. Patients with homozygous wild genotype CYP2E1 c1/c1 had a higher risk of hepatotoxicity (20.0{\%}; odds ratio [OR], 2.52) than those with mutant allele c2 (CYP2E1 c1/c2 or c2/c2, 9.0{\%} P = .009). If CYP2E1 c1/c2 or c2/c2 genotype combined with rapid acetylator status was regarded as the reference group, the risk of hepatotoxicity increased from 3.94 for CYP2E1 c1/c1 with rapid acetylator status to 7.43 for CYP2E1 c1/c1 with slow acetylator status. After adjustment for acetylator status and age, the CYP2E1 c1/c1 genotype remained an independent risk factor for hepatotoxicity (OR, 2.38; P = .017). Furthermore, under the administration of isoniazid, the volunteers with CYP2E1 c1/c1 genotype had higher CYP2E1 activity than those with other genotypes had and, hence, might produce more hepatotoxins. In conclusion, CYP 2E1 genetic polymorphism may be associated with susceptibility to antituberculosis drug-induced hepatitis.},

abstract = {RATIONALE Globally there are approximately 9 million new active tuberculosis cases and 1.4 million deaths annually. Effective antituberculosis treatment monitoring is difficult as there are no existing biomarkers of poor adherence or inadequate treatment earlier than 2 months after treatment initiation. Inadequate treatment leads to worsening disease, disease transmission and drug resistance. OBJECTIVES To determine if blood transcriptional signatures change in response to antituberculosis treatment and could act as early biomarkers of a successful response. METHODS Blood transcriptional profiles of untreated active tuberculosis patients in South Africa were analysed before, during (2 weeks and 2 months), at the end of (6 months) and after (12 months) antituberculosis treatment, and compared to individuals with latent tuberculosis. An active-tuberculosis transcriptional signature and a specific treatment-response transcriptional signature were derived. The specific treatment response transcriptional signature was tested in two independent cohorts. Two quantitative scoring algorithms were applied to measure the changes in the transcriptional response. The most significantly represented pathways were determined using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis. RESULTS An active tuberculosis 664-transcript signature and a treatment specific 320-transcript signature significantly diminished after 2 weeks of treatment in all cohorts, and continued to diminish until 6 months. The transcriptional response to treatment could be individually measured in each patient. CONCLUSIONS Significant changes in the transcriptional signatures measured by blood tests were readily detectable just 2 weeks after treatment initiation. These findings suggest that blood transcriptional signatures could be used as early surrogate biomarkers of successful treatment response.},

abstract = {Multivariate statistical batch processing (BP) analysis of 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) urine spectra was employed to establish time-dependent metabolic variations in animals treated with the model hepatotoxin hydrazine. Hydrazine was administered orally to rats (at 90 mg kg−1), and urine samples were collected from dosed rats and matched control animals (n = 5 per group) at time points up to 168 h post-dose. Urine samples were analysed via 1H NMR spectroscopy and partial least squares-based batch processing analysis, treating each rat as an individual batch comprising a series of timed urine samples. A model defining the mean urine profile was established for the control group, and samples obtained from hydrazine-treated animals were assessed using this model. Time-dependent deviations from the control model were evident in all hydrazine-treated animals, and hepatotoxicity was manifested by increased urinary excretion of taurine, creatine, 2-aminoadipate, citrulline and $\beta$-alanine together with depletion of urinary levels of citrate, succinate and hippurate. The experiment was repeated at six different pharmaceutical centres in order to assess the robustness of the technology and to establish the natural variability in the data. Results were consistent across the data for all centres. BP plots showed a characteristic pattern for each toxin, allowing the time points at which there were maximum metabolic differences to be determined and providing a means of visualizing the net toxin-induced metabolic movement of urinary metabolism. BP may prove to be a powerful metabonomic tool in defining time-dependent metabolic consequences of toxicity and is an efficient means of visualizing inter-animal variations in response as well as defining multivariate statistical limits of normality in terms of biofluid composition.

abstract = {Distribution of isoniazid and its metabolites was observed in the liver, kidney, lung and plasma after the subcutaneous administration of isoniazid to rats. The tissue levels of isoniazid, acetylisoniazid, acetylhydrazine, 1,2-diacetylhydrazine and hydrazine were determined by mass fragmentography using a gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer equipped with a multiple ion detector-peak matcher. Using the compounds labeled with a stable isotope as an internal standard, namely the isotope dilution method, made it possible to estimate trace amounts of these metabolites in the tissues. The amount of hydrazine was much less than the other hydrazines, but the metabolite which is well known as a mutagen, could be successfully detected in the tissues and plasma. The greater part of free hydrazine is formed through a direct hydrolysis of isoniazid. The isoniazid-hydrolyzing activity was found to be significantly higher in the liver homogenate. This suggested that hydrazine formation is mainly caused by hepatic hydrolysis.},

A dose of 20 mg hydrazine/kg caused the accumulation of lipid, swelling of mitochondria, and the appearance of microbodies in both periportal and midzonal hepatocytes and in the proximal tubular cells of the kidney. These changes were detectable by light or electron microscopy 24 h after dosing with hydrazine. A dose of 60 mg/kg was the highest dose tolerated for 24 h, but the severity of the fatty liver was similar to that after a dose of 40 mg/kg. The accumulation of lipid droplets and the swelling of mitochondria were detectable by electron microscopy 30 min after dosing, but the accumulation of fat could not be detected by light microscopy until 4 h after dosing. Pretreatment of animals with phenobarbital or piperonyl butoxide respectively reduced and increased the severity of the fatty liver. Pyruvate azine was much less toxic than the parent hydrazine on a molar basis, although some fatty vacuolation was detectable in midzonal hepatocytes.},

abstract = {The plasma concentrations of isoniazid and its hydrazino metabolites, acetylisoniazid, acetylhydrazine and diacetylhydrazine, were measured by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry in 12 healthy subjects after the ingestion of 300 mg of isoniazid. The area under the plasma concentration-time curve of acetylisoniazid and diacetylhydrazine increased with increasing rate of acetylation of isoniazid. In contrast, the area under the plasma concentration-time curve of acetylhydrazine, the postulated precursor of a toxic metabolite formed from isoniazid, was greater in slow acetylators. This occurred even though rapid acetylators generated more acetylisoniazid and thus more acetylhydrazine from isoniazid, because the rapid acetylators also acetylated acetylhydrazine faster to diacetylhydrazine than did the slow acetylators. Due to this complex relationship between area under the plasma concentration-time curve of acetylhydrazine and the rate of isoniazid acetylation (i.e., a faster rate of formation of acetylhydrazine is accompanied by a faster clearance to diacetylhydrazine), the rate of acetylation of isoniazid minimally influences the exposure of most patients to acetylhydrazine. This pharmacokinetic analysis, however, also shows that the apparent plasma half-life of acetylhydrazine is about five times longer than the plasma half-life of isoniazid, and thus repeated doses of isoniazid should lead to an accumulation of acetylhydrazine in the slowest acetylators in which the plasma half-life of acetylhydrazine is 20-plus hr.},

abstract = {A fluorescent derivative of D-glucose, 2-NBDG, which was previously developed for the evaluation of glucose uptake activity by living cells, was used on Escherichia coli cells and its fate after incorporation in the cells was investigated. 2-NBDG was converted to another fluorescent derivative (2-NBDG metabolite) immediately after it was taken by E. coli cells. This 2-NBDG metabolite was then decomposed to non-fluorescent forms. 2-NBDG metabolite was decomposed into the original 2-NBDG by G6Pase with concurrent liberation of inorganic phosphate. Furthermore, FAB/MS analysis showed that its molecular weight was 420, the same value as that of 2-NBDG 6-phosphate. These indicate 2-NBDG metabolite should be 2-NBDG 6-phosphate. Based on these results, the feasibility of 2-NBDG as a fluorescent non-toxic probe for glucose uptake activity and its application to viability assessment of various living systems are discussed.},

abstract = {Hydrazine causes a dose-related increase in liver triglycerides and in liver weight and causes a decrease in hepatic glutathione. The threshold dose for the toxic effect is around 10 mg/kg, and the optimal effect is seen after a dose of 40 mg/kg. The effect of hydrazine on liver weight and glutathione was detectable within 30 min of dosing, but the elevation of hepatic triglycerides was not detectable until 4 h after dosing. At 24 h after a dose of 60 mg hydrazine/kg, hepatic reduced glutathione was approximately 50{\%} of the control value and triglycerides were about 7 times the normal level. In vitro studies indicated that hydrazine is metabolized by rat liver microsomal enzymes, this being dependent on NADPH and oxygen. Pretreatment of animals with phenobarbital or piperonyl butoxide respectively decreases and increases the hepatotoxicity. Prior depletion of hepatic glutathione by administration of diethyl maleate had no effect on the toxicity. Pyruvate azine, a probable metabolite of hydrazine, is much less toxic than hydrazine itself on a molar basis. These and other results suggest that although hydrazine is metabolized via several routes, the hepatotoxicity may well be due to the parent compound rather than a metabolite.},

abstract = {The decision to treat active tuberculosis (TB) is dependent on microbiological tests for the organism or evidence of disease compatible with TB in people with a high demographic risk of exposure. The tuberculin skin test and peripheral blood interferon-$\gamma$ release assays do not distinguish active TB from a cleared or latent infection. Microbiological culture of mycobacteria is slow. Moreover, the sensitivities of culture and microscopy for acid-fast bacilli and nucleic acid detection by PCR are often compromised by difficulty in obtaining samples from the site of disease. Consequently, we need sensitive and rapid tests for easily obtained clinical samples, which can be deployed to assess patients exposed to TB, discriminate TB from other infectious, inflammatory or autoimmune diseases, and to identify subclinical TB in HIV-1 infected patients prior to commencing antiretroviral therapy. We discuss the evaluation of peripheral blood transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics to develop the next generation of rapid diagnostics for active TB. We catalogue the studies published to date seeking to discriminate active TB from healthy volunteers, patients with latent infection and those with other diseases. We identify the limitations of these studies and the barriers to their adoption in clinical practice. In so doing, we aim to develop a framework to guide our approach to discovery and development of diagnostic biomarkers for active TB.},

Acetylhydrazine was administered i.v. with and without prior ingestion of 300 mg of isoniazid. In the studies with isoniazid, 15N2-acetylhydrazine was administered in order to distinguish exogenous acetylhydrazine from the unlabeled acetylhydrazine formed from isoniazid. In each subject (two fast and three slow acetylators) the rate of elimination of acetylhydrazine was similar to the rate of elimination of isoniazid suggesting that the two compounds are subject to the same acetylation polymorphism. In the presence of isoniazid the rate of elimination of acetylhydrazine was consistently lower than in the absence of isoniazid, and the urinary excretion of diacetylhydrazine and the ratio of diacetyl/acetylhydrazine in urine decreased. The data indicate that therapeutic concentrations of isoniazid and its metabolites inhibit the acetylation of acetylhydrazine in humans.

Hydrazine caused a dose-dependent loss of viability, leakage of LDH, depletion of GSH and ATP and an inhibition of the incorporation of 3H-leucine into protein. 2. Pretreatment with DEDC increased, whereas hydrazine and acetone pretreatments decreased the cytoxicity and biochemical effects of hydrazine. Pretreatment with isoniazid slightly increased hydrazine cytotoxicity. Acetone pretreatment reduced the inhibition of protein synthesis caused by hydrazine compared to the control. 3. 4-Nitrophenol hydroxylase activity (P4502E1) correlated with viability, LDH leakage, ATP and GSH depletion in cells from the control, DEDC, acetone and hydrazine pretreated rats. 4. The activities of PROD (P4502B1) and EROD (P4501A1/1A2) also correlated with the above parameters for all treatments.
